## Methods
All steps are carried out at room temperature, unless indicated otherwise.

#### Limited Cycle PCR 
(50 μl reaction)

  1.	Prepare on ice:
	* 15 μl ddH2O.
	* 25 μl Phusion Hot-start Master Mix.
	* 2.5 μl 10 µM Forward primer.
	* 2.5 μl 10 µM Reverse primer with T7 promoter sequence.
	* 2.5 μl 1:50 dilution of Oligopaints library (see Note A4.3).
	* 2.5 μl 20X EvaGreen.

  2.	Run reactions on a Real-Time (RT) PCR machine, stopping the reaction for each tube while it is still in the exponential growth phase (i.e., before it reaches saturation). A calibration run may be necessary to identify when this will happen. PCR protocol:
	1. 	Incubate at 98°C for 3 minutes.
	2. 	Incubate at 98°C for 5 seconds.
	3.  Incubate at 72°C for 20 seconds.
	4.  Cycle through steps 2.1.2 and 2.1.3 approximately 15-25 times (see Note A4.4 regarding number of cycles).

  3.	Recommended: validate PCR reaction by running 2 µl out on a 2% agarose borax gel. 
	1. Dissolve 2 g agarose in 100 ml borax solution by boiling for 30 seconds.
	2. Cast the hot solution and let sit until gelled.
	3. A satisfying result will feature a single band, which will be more likely to happen if the PCR reaction does not saturate.

#### PCR cleanup (50 µl reaction)
  1.	In a 1.5 ml tube, add 350 μL Zymo DNA binding buffer to ~50 μL of PCR product.
  2.	Transfer to a Zymo DCC-5 column and spin at >10,000 g for 30 seconds.
  3.	Add 200 µl DNA Wash Buffer to column and spin at >10,000 g for 30 seconds.
  4.	Repeat the wash step.
  5.	Discard flow-through by aspirating the collection tube dry.
  6.	Spin at >10,000 g for 1 minute to remove residual buffer.
  7.	Transfer column to clean 1.5 ml tube.
  8.	Incubate at room temperature for 1 minute.
  9.	Elute DNA in 11 µl ddH2O.

#### T7 reaction (30 μl reaction)
  1.	Prepare on ice in RNase-free environment:
	* 10 µl PCR product.
	* 10 µl NTP buffer mix (from HiScribe kit).
	* 2 µl T7 Pol Mix (from HiScribe kit).
	* 1 µl RNase inhibitor.
	* 7 µl ddH2O.
  2.	Incubate at 37˚C for 4-16 hrs.

#### RT reaction (70 µl reaction)
  1.	Prepare on ice in RNase-free environment:
	* 7 µl dNTP (10 mM each).
	* 14 µl Maxima H Minus RT buffer.
	* 10 µl 100 μM labeled or unlabeled primer.
	* 5 µl or less Maxima H Minus RT enzyme.
	* 4 µl RNase inhibitor.
	* 30 µl RNA from T7 reaction.
  2.	Incubate at 50˚C for 1-2 hours (no pre-denaturing step required).
  3.	Digest remaining RNA:
	* Mix 1:1 0.5 M EDTA and 1 M NaOH.
	* Add 50 µl of the NaOH-EDTA solution.
	* Heat at 95˚C for 10 minutes.
  4.	Recommended: Test reaction product by running 2 ul out on a 15% urea TBE gel.  Use urea-loading buffer.  
	* Run gel in 60°C water bath for ~40 minutes to ensure probe is denatured. This allows for clear separation between the RT primer and the desired ssDNA probe.
	*  80% or more incorporation of the RT primer would be a satisfying outcome.

#### Probe Cleanup
1.	Add 240 μl Oligo binding buffer and mix. (The volume of Oligo binding buffer added should 2X the volume of the sample after addition of NaOH-EDTA; 2 x 120 µl = 240 µl).
2.	Split volume evenly into two 1.5 ml tubes (180 µl per tube). To each tube add 480 µl of 100% ethanol and mix. (The total volume of ethanol added should be 8X the volume of the sample after addition of NaOH-EDTA; 8 x 120 µl = 960 µl = 2 x 480 µl).
3.	Transfer the solution of one tube to a Zymo DCC-25 column and spin at ≥10,000 g for 30 seconds. (Note, the maximum capacity of the column is 750 µl.)  Dispose the wash through, add contents of the second tube to the column, and spin again at ≥10,000g for 30 seconds. 
4.	Add 750 μl DNA Wash Buffer.
5.	Spin at >10,000 g for 30 seconds and discard flow-through.
6.	Spin at ≥10,000g for 30 seconds to remove excess buffer.
7.	Transfer column to a clean 1.5 ml tube.
8.	Elute in 30 μl ddH2O.
9.	Measure final probe concentration.
