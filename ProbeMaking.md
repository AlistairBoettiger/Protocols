## Methods
All steps are carried out at room temperature, unless indicated otherwise.

#### Limited Cycle PCR 
(50 μl reaction)

  1.	Prepare on ice:
	* 15 μl ddH2O.
	* 25 μl Phusion Hot-start Master Mix.
	* 2.5 μl 10 µM Forward primer.
	* 2.5 μl 10 µM Reverse primer with T7 promoter sequence.
	* 2.5 μl 1:50 dilution of Oligopaints library.
	* 2.5 μl 20X EvaGreen.

  2.	Run reactions on a Real-Time (RT) PCR machine, stopping the reaction for each tube while it is still in the exponential growth phase (i.e., before it reaches saturation). A calibration run may be necessary to identify when this will happen. PCR protocol:
	1. 	Incubate at 98°C for 3 minutes.
	2. 	Incubate at 98°C for 5 seconds.
	3.  Incubate at 72°C for 20 seconds.
	4.  Cycle through steps 2.1.2 and 2.1.3 approximately 15-25 times.

  3.	Recommended: validate PCR reaction by running 2 µl out on a 2% agarose borax gel. 
	1. Dissolve 2 g agarose in 100 ml borax solution by boiling for 30 seconds.
	2. Cast the hot solution and let sit until gelled.
	3. A satisfying result will feature a single band, which will be more likely to happen if the PCR reaction does not saturate.
	4. If amplification fails, try 3-step PCR with an annealing temperature of 60-70C.

#### PCR cleanup (50 µl reaction)
  1.	In a 1.5 ml tube, add 350 μL Zymo DNA binding buffer to ~50 μL of PCR product.
  2.	Transfer to a Zymo DCC-5 column and spin at >10,000 g for 30 seconds.
  3.	Add 200 µl DNA Wash Buffer to column and spin at >10,000 g for 30 seconds.
  4.	Repeat the wash step.
  5.	Discard flow-through by aspirating the collection tube dry.
  6.	Spin at >10,000 g for 1 minute to remove residual buffer.
  7.	Transfer column to clean 1.5 ml tube.
  8.	Incubate at room temperature for 1 minute.
  9.	Elute DNA in 11 µl ddH2O.

#### T7 reaction (30 μl reaction)
  1.	Prepare on ice in RNase-free environment:
	* 10 µl PCR product.
	* 10 µl NTP buffer mix (from HiScribe kit).
	* 2 µl T7 Pol Mix (from HiScribe kit).
		* Note: This enzyme/buffer mix is the most expensive component of the reaction. Experiments suggest reducing the concentration of enzyme at this step will reduce product yield. 
	* 1 µl RNase inhibitor.
		* Note: Any RNase inhibitor should work at this step, it is not necessary to use the more expensive RNasin.
	* 7 µl ddH2O.
  2.	Incubate at 37˚C for 4-16 hrs.

#### RT reaction (50 µl reaction)
  1.	Prepare on ice in RNase-free environment:
	* 4 µl dNTP (10 mM each).
	* 10 µl RT Buffer from Maxima H Minus kit.
	* 2-10 µl 100 μM labeled or unlabeled primer.
		* Note: When using labeled primer, you may wish to run a test scale-reaction to determine the incorporation efficiency and determine the amount of primer to add. Use 5 uL of RNA and 1-5 uL of labeled primer in a 20 uL reaction and run out 2 uL of product on a PAGE gel (see below).  
	* 4 µl or less Maxima H Minus RT enzyme.
		* Note: Experiments suggest it is possible to reduce the enzyme concentration 10 fold without loss in product yield.  This can substantially reduce the cost or probe construction.
	* 4 µl RNasin RNase inhibitor.
		* Note: It is essential to use an RNase inhibitor engineered to work at 50C, RNasin does, most do not.
	* 25 µl RNA from T7 reaction.
		* Note: It is recommended to add these components to the same PCR tube used for the T7 reactions.  The 30 uL T7 reaction will experience some evaporation, so the final concentration is closer to 25 uL.
  2.	Incubate at 50˚C for 1-2 hours (no pre-denaturing step required).
  3.	Digest remaining RNA:
	* Mix 1:1 0.5 M EDTA and 1 M NaOH.
	* Add 25 µl of the NaOH-EDTA solution.
	* Heat at 95˚C for 10 minutes.
  4.	Recommended: Test reaction product by running 2 ul out on a 15% urea TBE gel.  Use urea-loading buffer.  
	* Run gel in 60°C water bath for ~40 minutes to ensure probe is denatured. This allows for clear separation between the RT primer and the desired ssDNA probe.
	*  80% or more incorporation of the RT primer would be a satisfying outcome.

#### Probe Cleanup
1.	Add 150 μl Oligo binding buffer to a clean 1.5 mL tube. (The volume of Oligo binding buffer added should 2X the volume of the sample after addition of NaOH-EDTA; 2 x 75 µl = 150 µl).
3.	Add NaOH-treated RT product (75 μL) to each tube and mix by pipetting.	
2.	Add 600 μL 100% Ethanol to each tube and mix. (The total volume of ethanol added should be 8X the volume of the sample after addition of NaOH-EDTA; 8 x 75 µl = 600 µl).
3.	Transfer the solution of one tube to a Zymo DCC-5 or DCC-25 column, spin at ≥10,000 g for 30 seconds, and discard washthrough.
	* Notes: 
		- 1: The maximum capacity of the column is 750 µl. It is recommended to add half the solution, spin, remove wash-through, and add the other half and spin again.
		- 2: High concentration probes may saturate the DCC-5 column and require DCC-25s.   
4.	Add 750 μl DNA Wash Buffer.
5.	Spin at >10,000 g for 30 seconds and discard flow-through.
6.	Spin at ≥10,000 g for 30 seconds to remove excess buffer.
7.	Transfer column to a clean 1.5 ml tube.
8.	Elute in 30 μl ddH2O.
9.	Measure final probe concentration.
