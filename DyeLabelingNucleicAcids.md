## Dye Labeling of Nucleic Acids

### Materials:
* Cy5 Mono-reactive Dye Pack (GE Healthcare PA25001)
* Cy3 Mono-reactive Dye Pack (GE Healthcare PA23031)
* Dharmacon Deprotection Buffer (100mM acetic acid, pH 3.8)
* TE Buffer (10mM tris pH 8.0/1mM EDTA)
* 2x Loading Buffer (96% formamide/20mM EDTA, prepare using freshly deionized formamide)

### Procedure:
Step 0: Remove 2’-ACE Protecting Groups (RNA oligos only)
1.	Dissolve the oligos in 400µL of deprotection buffer by pipetting up and down, and vortexing for 10 s.

2.	Spin down tubes, then incubate at 60°C for 30 min (2 hr if modified w/ biotin).

3.	Speedvac to reduce volume to ~300µL.

Step 1: EtOH precipitation to remove contaminating salts
The general procedure for ethanol precipitation is to add 1/10 volume of 3M NaOAc and 2.5 volumes (including the NaOAc) of EtOH to your sample (for RNA use 3 volumes of EtOH), incubate at -20°C for >30 min, centrifuge at max speed for 30 min at 4°C, wash with 1 mL 70% EtOH, spin for 5 min, remove supertantant, then speedvac or air dry to remove residual EtOH.

Step 2:  React with dyes
1.	Resuspend pellet in 100µL of 0.1M NaHCO3 (make fresh and filter).

2.	Dissolve the dye in 50µL of DMSO, then add to the DNA solution.  One tube is sufficient to label 30nmol of oligo.

3.	Incubate reaction mixture at 37°C for 1-2 hrs.  Cover with foil to prevent photobleaching during the incubation.  Mix every ~30 min.

4.	Cool reactions on ice, then add 15µL of 3M NaOAc, pH 5.2 to each tube.

5.	Add 495µL of ice-cold EtOH to each tube, then incubate at -20°C for >30 min.

6.	Centrifuge at maximum speed for 30 min at 4°C.

7.	Remove supernatant and wash w/ 1mL of 70% EtOH.

8.	Centrifuge at maximum speed for 5 min at room temp, then remove supernatant.

Step 3:  PAGE Purification
1.	Pour a thick TBE-Urea gel of the appropriate concentration of acrylamide.

2.	Pre-run gel at 50mA for > 1hr.

3.	Dissolve the precipitated oligos in 30µL TE and add an equal volume of 2x loading buffer.

4.	Load samples onto gel and run gel at 50mA.

5.	Cut out band, crush using pestle, add 4mL of nuclease free H2O, then incubate overnight at 37°C with shaking.

6.	Spin down PAGE extraction, save supernatant, and extract gel fragments with an additional 2 mL of nuclease free H2O for >2 hrs.

7.	Spin down PAGE extraction and combine with previous supernatant.

8.	Perform butanol extractions (add 3 volumes of 1-BuOH to the sample, vortex, let layers separate, spin briefly, then discard organic [top] layer) to reduce volume to ~300mL.

9.	If residual polyacrylamide fragments are present, centrifuge aqueous layer to remove gel fragments.

10.	EtOH precipitation.


Step 4: HPLC Purification
1.	Remove supernatant and resuspend pellet in 60µL of HPLC buffer A.

2.	Purify samples on HPLC following HPLC protocol.

3.	Pool fractions containing labeled oligos and speedvac to reduce volume to 0.3mL.

4.	EtOH precipitation.
