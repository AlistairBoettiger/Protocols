## Dye Labeling of Nucleic Acids

### Materials:
* Cy5 Mono-reactive Dye Pack (GE Healthcare PA25001)
* Cy3 Mono-reactive Dye Pack (GE Healthcare PA23031)
* Dharmacon Deprotection Buffer (100mM acetic acid, pH 3.8)
* TE Buffer (10mM tris pH 8.0/1mM EDTA)
* 2x Loading Buffer (96% formamide/20mM EDTA, prepare using freshly deionized formamide)

### Procedure:
**Step 0: Remove 2’-ACE Protecting Groups (RNA oligos only)**

1.	Dissolve the oligos in 400µL of deprotection buffer by pipetting up and down, and vortexing for 10 s.

2.	Spin down tubes, then incubate at 60°C for 30 min (2 hr if modified w/ biotin).

3.	Speedvac to reduce volume to ~300µL.

**Step 1: EtOH precipitation to remove contaminating salts**

The general procedure for ethanol precipitation is to add 1/10 volume of 3M NaOAc and 2.5 volumes (including the NaOAc) of EtOH to your sample (for RNA use 3 volumes of EtOH), incubate at -20°C for >30 min, centrifuge at max speed for 30 min at 4°C, wash with 1 mL 70% EtOH, spin for 5 min, remove supertantant, then speedvac or air dry to remove residual EtOH.

**Step 2:  React with dyes**

1.	Resuspend pellet in 100µL of 0.1M NaHCO3 (make fresh and filter).

2.	Dissolve the dye in 50µL of DMSO, then add to the DNA solution.  One tube is sufficient to label 30nmol of oligo.

3.	Incubate reaction mixture at 37°C for 1-2 hrs.  Cover with foil to prevent photobleaching during the incubation.  Mix every ~30 min.

4.	Cool reactions on ice, then add 15µL of 3M NaOAc, pH 5.2 to each tube.

5.	Add 495µL of ice-cold EtOH to each tube, then incubate at -20°C for >30 min.

6.	Centrifuge at maximum speed for 30 min at 4°C.

7.	Remove supernatant and wash w/ 1mL of 90% EtOH.  

8.	Repeat step 7 3x.  Spin to inbetween rinses for 5 min to reattach pellet.


9. Air dry pellet. 


**Step 3: HPLC Purification**

1.	Remove supernatant and resuspend pellet in 60µL of HPLC buffer A.

2.	Purify samples on HPLC following HPLC protocol.

3.	Pool fractions containing labeled oligos and speedvac to reduce volume to 0.3mL.

4.	EtOH precipitation.
