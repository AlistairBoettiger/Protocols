### OligoPaint Protocol 
1. Plate cells on polylysine coated coverslips
2. allow cells ~1hr to attach
3. Wash twice with 1x PBS to remove media and unattached cells
3. Fix cells 10' in 5% PFA
4. wash out PFA in 1x PBS
5. Incubate for 10’ in 1X PBS + 0.5% v/v Triton X-100 at RT
6. Incubate for 2’ in 1X PBS at RT
7. Incubate for 30’ in 1X PBS + 20% v/v glycerol
8. Immerse the slide in liquid nitrogen using forceps and allow to freeze completely (LN2 should stop boiling.)  This step is easiest done with slides on a ceramic rack
9. Allow the slide to thaw face-up on a paper towel or on ceramic rack.
10. Repeat steps 8 and 9 two additional times
11. Incubate for 1’ in 1X PBS at RT
12. Incubate for 5’ in 1X PBS at RT
13. Incubate for 5’ in 1X PBS at RT
14. Incubate for 5’ in 0.1 M HCl at RT  (425 uL of 36% HCl in 50 mL = .1 M)
15. Incubate for 1’ in 2X SSC at RT
16. Incubate for 1’ in 2X SSC at RT
17. Incubate for 1’ in 2X SSC at RT
18. Incubate for 35’ in 2X SSC + 50% v/v formamide at RT
19. Tap slides dry on a paper towel (never allowing the face of the slide containing the cells
to come into contact with the paper towel)
20. Create a hybridization cocktail consisting of 12.5 μl of 2X hyb. mix (4X SSCT + 20% w/v
dextran sulfate), 12.5 μl of formamide, and 20-40 pmole of each Oligopaints probe set per slide.  Optional 10 ug RNase A.
21. Add the hybridization cocktail (typically 26-28 μl after adding the probe sets) to a 22x22
cm coverslip, invert the slide onto the coverslip, and seal with rubber cement
22. Allow the rubber cement to dry for 5’ at RT
23. Denature the slides for 3’ at 78°C on a water-immersed heat block
24. Hybridize overnight at 47°C in a humidified chamber
25. The next day, remove the coverslip and wash for 15’ in 2X SSCT (2X SSC + 0.1% v/v
Tween 20) at 60°C
26. Incubate in 2X SSCT for 10’ at RT
27. Incubate in 0.2X SSC for 10’ at RT
