## OligoPaint Protocol 
### Fixation
1. Plate cells on polylysine coated coverslips
2. allow cells ~1hr to attach
3. Check cell density on microscope.  Cells should be mostly confluent.
4. Wash twice with 1x PBS to remove media and unattached cells
5. Fix cells 10' in 5% PFA
6. wash out PFA in 1x PBS.  Cells may now be stored at 4C for a few days.

### Permeabilization
5. Incubate cells for 7' in 1 mg/mL Sodium Borohydride in ddH2O (make fresh!)
6. Wash 2x with PBS
7. Incubate for 10' in 1X PBS + 0.5% v/v Triton X-100 at RT
8. Incubate for 2' in 1X PBS at RT
9. Incubate for 30' in 1X PBS + 20% v/v glycerol
10. Immerse the slide in liquid nitrogen using forceps and allow to freeze completely (LN2 should stop boiling.)  This step is easiest done with slides on a ceramic rack
11. Allow the slide to thaw face-up on a paper towel or on ceramic rack.
12. Repeat steps liquid nitrogen bath 2x. 
13. Incubate for 1' in 1X PBS at RT
14. Wash 2x for 5' in 1X PBS at RT
15. Incubate for 5' in 0.1 M HCl at RT  (425 uL of 36% HCl in 50 mL = 0.1 M)
16. Wash 3x for 1' in 2X SSC at RT
17. Incubate for 35’ in 2X SSC + 50% v/v formamide 0.1% Tween at RT.  Cells may be stored at 4C for several days.

### Hybridization
18. Tap slides dry on a paper towel (never allowing the face of the slide containing the cells
to come into contact with the paper towel)
19. Create a hybridization cocktail consisting of 12.5 μl of 2X hyb. mix (4X SSCT + 20% w/v
dextran sulfate), 12.5 μl of formamide, and 20-40 pmole of each Oligopaints probe set per slide.  Optional 10 ug RNase A.
20. Add the hybridization cocktail (typically 26-28 μl after adding the probe sets) to a 22x22
cm coverslip, invert the slide onto the coverslip, and seal with rubber cement
21. Allow the rubber cement to dry for 5' at RT
22. Denature the slides for 3' at 78°C on a water-immersed heat block
23. Hybridize overnight at 47°C in a humidified chamber
24. The next day, remove the coverslip and wash for 20’ in 2X SSCT (2X SSC + 0.1% v/v
Tween 20) at 60°C
25. Incubate in 2X SSCT for 10’ at RT
26. Store in 2x SSC at 4C for up to 2 weeks.
