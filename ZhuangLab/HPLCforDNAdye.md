## HPLC Protocol

### Materials:
* Buffer A (0.1M acetic acid/0.1M triethylamine/5% acetonitrile pH 7)
To make buffer A, dissolve appropriate amount of TEA and MeCN in water, then titrate to pH 7.0 with HOAc.
* Buffer B (100% acetonitrile)
* Agilent Eclipse XDB-C8 Column (4.6 x 250 mm)

### Important notes:
* Filter all HPLC buffers! (filter using whatman filter paper, not the Nalgene filters as the organics in the buffer will dissolve the plastic filter)
* Pressure on HPLC system should not exceed 20MPa

### Procedure:
1.	Purge buffers A and B with Ar for 15 min.
2.	Check waste bottle.
3.	Start Unicorn Software and log in as user “greg.”
4.	Wash the system with 20% EtOH (pump wash purify A1 & B1 then flow @ 2 mL/min, 50% B).  Ensure that y-axes for the absorption meters are scaled 0-3000.
5.	Wash the fraction collector (set outlet flowpath to F2, then perform AcuumulatorWash [5 strokes])
6.	Wash the injection loop (set injection valve to inject).
7.	Switch to buffers A and B (pump wash).
8.	Set flow rate to 1mL/min, 100% B.
9.	Attach column (screw bottom in first, then add top piece by dripping in buffer).
10.	Wash column in buffer B for 5 min.
11.	Switch to 0% B over 2 min.
12.	Rinse syringe in Buffer A.
13.	Switch injection valve to “load,” rinse injection loop with Buffer A (2-3x).
14.	Load sample (60µL) into syringe and place into injection port.  Ensure injection valve is set to “load,” but don’t depress the syringe plunger yet.
15.	End the current program, then run the “RNAcollect” method.
16.	Depress syringe plunger to load sample into the sample loop within the first minute.
17.	After method reaches 10% B, switch ouput path to F2.
18.	Collect 0.3mL fractions when the sample elutes.
19.	After sample has eluted, switch to 100% B over 2 min.
20.	Run for 10 min at 100% B.
21.	If running more samples, repeat steps 10-19.

### Clean up
1.	Make sure column has washed for at least 15 min in 100% B.
2.	Detatch column and store at room temp.
3.	Switch to 20% EtOH (pump wash).
4.	Rinse system (fraction collector, injection loop) with 20% EtOH.
5.	Shut down the system.
