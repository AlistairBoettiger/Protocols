## Notes
* Samples prepared for STORM should only be labeled within a day of inteded imaging session.  
* Sections are collected on glass coverslips coated with chromium (1.5 mg/mL) gelatin (15 mg/mL) -- see sectioning Protocol for Subbing Coverglass and Protocol for Ultra-Cryo sectioning.
* Glass with cryo-protected frozen gelatin embedded embryos is stored at -20C.   
* This protocol adopted from Wu lab protocol for oligoPaints on cultured cells.  03/02/13

## Protocol

### Staining
1.  Thaw sample and dissolve excess sucrose by incubating in PBT + DAPI on a platform humidity chamber.  
2.  Check tissue quality on fluorescense microscope using DAPI
4.  Incubate sample in 2x SSCT for 5 min in coplin Jar. 
5.  Incubate sample in 50% formamide/2x SSCT for 5min.  Store at 4C if not needed right away.
6.  Remove coplin jar(s) containing samples from 4°C allow them to warm to room temperature
7.  Incubate slides in 2X SSCT + 50% (v/v) formamide for 2.5’ at 92°C in a prewarmed coplin jar.  (Heat jars in waterbath).
8.  Transfer slides to a coplin jar containing 2X SSCT + 50% formamide at 60°C and incubate for 20’.
9.  Remove the slides from the 60°C coplin jar and allow them to cool to room temperature
10. Add 25 μl of a hybridization cocktail composed of 2X SSCT, 50% formamide, 10% (w/v) dextran sulfate, 10 μg RNase A, and 10-20 pmole of Oligopaints probe to a glass slide
11. Invert coverslip onto the cocktail-containing glass slide. Seal with rubber cement.
12. Allow the rubber cement to air-dry for 5’ at room temperature
13. Denature for 2.5’ at 92°C by placing slides top of a water-immersed heat block inside a closed water bath (trying to keep temperature as uniform as possible via humidity). 

*   *[Work around: Place slide face up on top of inverted 92C heat block with a little bit of water to seal the slide to the heat block for 2.5 min]*

14.  Transfer slides to a humidified chamber and hybridize overnight at 37°C or 42°C (depending on probe length)
15.  The next day, remove the coverslip carefully and wash in a pre-warmed coplin jar containing 2X SSCT at 60°C for 15’
16.  Transfer samples to a coplin jar containing 2X SSCT at room temperature and incubate for 10’
17. Sample may be stored at 4C in 2X SSCT for ~48 hrs.

### Preparation for STORM Imaging

4.  Prepare a clean glass with double stick tape supports down each side.
5.   Remove coverglass from the coplin jar and gently tap them dry on paper towels – take care to just tap the thin edge of the slide and to never allow the surface containing the sample to directly contact the paper towels.
6. Invert coverglass ontop of glass slide.  Trim off extra tape.  Add Imaging buffer.  Seal with Epoxy.
7. Let Epoxy dry
