### Fixation
1. Plate cells on polylysine coated coverslips (Add and immediately remove 400-1000 uL of polylysine solution to each coverslip.  Sterilize coverslips under UV for 10-20 minutes).  
2. allow cells ~1hr to attach
3. Check cell density on microscope.  Cells should be mostly confluent.
4. Wash twice with 1x PBS to remove media and unattached cells
5. Fix cells 10' in 5% formaldehyde in PBS.
6. wash out PFA in 1x PBS.  Cells may now be stored at 4C for a few days.

### Permeabilization
1. Incubate cells for 7' in 1 mg/mL Sodium Borohydride in ddH2O (make fresh!)
2. Wash 2x with PBS
3. Incubate for 10' in 1X PBS + 0.5% v/v Triton X-100 at RT
4. Incubate for 2' in 1X PBS at RT
5. Incubate for 30' in 1X PBS + 20% v/v glycerol
6. Immerse the slide in liquid nitrogen using forceps and allow to freeze completely (LN2 should stop boiling.)  This step is easiest done with slides on a ceramic rack
7. Allow the slide to thaw face-up on a paper towel or on ceramic rack.
8. Repeat steps liquid nitrogen bath 2x. 
9. Incubate for 1' in 1X PBS at RT
10. Wash 2x for 5' in 1X PBS at RT
11. Incubate for 5' in 0.1 M HCl at RT  (425 uL of 36% HCl in 50 mL = 0.1 M)
12. Wash 3x for 1' in PBS
13. for DNA FISH ONLY: incubate 1 hr at 37C in 10 ug/mL RNaseA in PBS.  NOTE: USE RNase pipettes and RNase (miniprep) Bench for all RNaseA work.  
14. Wash 3x for 1' in 2X SSC at RT
15. Incubate for 35’ in 2X SSC + 50% v/v formamide 0.1% Tween at RT.  Cells may be stored at 4C for several days.

### Hybridization
1. Prepare hybridization mix:  Add 30 - 60 pmol of probe and 1 uL of reporter-labeled secondary probe (100 uM) to hybrdization buffer (50% formamide, 2x SSC, 0.1% Tween-20, 10% Dextran-sulfate).  
     * If probe volume is >= 5 uL, use concentrated Hybe buffer: ( 60% formamide, 2.4x SSC, 0.12% Tween-20, 12% Dextran-sulfate) 
2. Add probe solution to a clean glass slide.
3. Gently tap coverslip of cells dry on a kimwipe.  Invert cells on solution on glass slide. 
4. Seal edges of coverslip with rubber cement and allow the rubber cement to dry for 5' at RT
5. Denature the slides for 3' at 78°C on a water-immersed heat block (current calibration has heat block set to 85C.  With water and glass on top this gets to 78C).
6. Hybridize overnight at 47°C in a humidified chamber (>= 16 hours)

### Post Hybe washes
24. Pre-warm 2x SSCT (2X SSC + 0.1% v/v Tween 20) to 60C (60C dry oven).  
25. Remove the coverslip and wash 2x for 10' each in 2X SSCT at 60C (in dry oven).
25. Incubate in 2X SSCT for 10’ at RT
26. Wash in 2x SSC.   Optional: Store in 2x SSC at 4C for up to 2 weeks. 

### Post Hybe Antibody Staining
1. Rinse 2x with PBT 
2. Wash 2x in PBT (5 min each)
3. incubate in blocking buffer 1 hour (dilute Western Blocking Reagent 1:5 in PBT).
4. incubate in antibodies diluted in blocking buffer (1:100 to 1:1000)
