# Drosophila Cell Culture

## Notes
Protocols adapted from the Drosophila Genome Resource Center [website](https://dgrc.bio.indiana.edu/Protocols?tab=cells).

## Thawing cells

1. Place 5 ml of an appropriate medium in a 25 cm2 T-flask. Recommended media are
described for each cell line on our website.
2. Remove the ampoule from the dry ice. Using a Pasteur pipet, add a few drops of medium
to the ampoule, and pipet up and down to thaw and mix the cells. Pipet the liquid back
into the flask or plate, and repeat as necessary.
3. Place the flask of freshly thawed cells into an appropriate incubator for 1-2 hr (25° for
most cell lines; lines requiring a different temperature are specified on the DGRC website).
4. Examine the culture in an inverted microscope. Usually, most of the cells are adhering
loosely to the substrate at this point. If this is the case, gently remove the supernatant,
and replace it with 5 ml of fresh medium. The purpose of this maneuver is to remove the
DMSO, which is toxic to many lines. Leave the flask in the incubator overnight, and
then repeat the change of medium.

## Growing Cells
### BG3
* Media = Schnieder's media (+Glut), 10% heat-inactivated FBS, insulin, 
* optional penicilin + streptomycin. Filter sterilize. 
* passage at 1:3, every 4-7 days
* very sensitive to overgrowth or overdilution. 

## Kc and S2
* Hi-Clone serum free media.
* passage at 1:10 every 4-7 days

## Freezing Cells
We strongly recommend that you prepare a few ampoules of frozen cells as soon as your cells
are growing well. Stored in liquid nitrogen, the cells are stable indefinitely. We use the
technique described below.

### Materials
* Freezing medium: M3+BPYE+20% FCS + 10% DMSO. Sterilize by filtration; store at
4°C.
* Sterile cryovials: A variety of brands are available from standard laboratory supply
companies.
* A wide-mouth Dewar flask with a tight-fitting stopper.
* A -70°C or -80°C freezer.
* A liquid nitrogen storage tank.

### Procedure
1. Prepare freezing medium: 90% fresh media, 10% DMSO
1. Start with a healthy culture at approximately 5x10^6 cell/mL (mid-exponential growth). 
1. Collect the cells by centrifugation at  1000 xg; discard the medium (supernatant).
1. Resuspend the cells in freezing medium, 0.25 x the original volume, to give a final
concentration of approximately 2x10^7  cells/mL. To resuspend cells, pipet the pellet up
and down with a Pasteur pipet or a serological pipet.
1. Dispense the cell suspension into cryovials, 0.5 mL per vial.
1. Please the tightly sealed vials of cell suspension into a room temperature cell-freezing container. 
1. Place the cell-freezing container into a -80°C freezer for 2-3 days to allow the ampoules to slowly cool to the temperature of the freezer.
1. Transfer the frozen ampoules to liquid nitrogen. After the ampoules have had at least an hour to equilibrate to liquid nitrogen temperature, thaw one ampoule to check for sterility and viability
