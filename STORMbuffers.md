## TCEP Buffer

*   0.2 M Tris pH 9  (200 uL Tris 1M pH 9.0)
*   1 mM Methyl viologen. (10 uL of 0.1 M stock.  Currently make fresh from powder.) (25.7 mg / mL)  (Toxic!)
*   1 mM Ascorbic Acid (10 uL of 0.1 M stock.  Currently make fresh from powder.)   (17.6 mg/mL)
*   25 mM TCEP (50 uL of a 0.5 M stock vial.  $5/vial, use fresh, no more than 1 day).
*   1% Glox (usual strength.  10 uL in 1 mL)
*   5% glucose
*   ddH2O -- fill to 1000 uL.

### TCEP Buffer information

*   See [publication][1] for more details
*   750 in TCEP 2800 photon (compared to 700 in BME and 3-400 in MEA).
*   Allows for ~equal photon yield 750 and 647 imaging.
*   Can image both at 200 Hz. (750 still better at 60 Hz.) 
*   not as robust -- concentration of TCEP matters, laser power effects duty cycle (higher laser power = lower duty cycle.  necessary for dense imaging)
*   750 gas laser causes vibrations that errode ability to see 'hollow' structure of microtubules (in any channel)
*   897 ultra camera runs at 60 Hz in 512x512 
*   not compatible with other dyes (e.g. Cy3B). 

## Standard STORM buffer

*   80 uL Dilution Buffer
*   20 uL of 50% Glucose
*   1 uL of BME
*   1.5 uL of GLOX solution

### Components:

1.  Dilution Buffer
* 50 mM NaCl 10-200* mM Tris, pH 8.0
> *(higher molar Tris recommended for longer STORM imaging)

1.  Oxygen Scavenger (GLOX) 

* 200 uL of Dilution Buffer (see above) 
* 14 mg Glucose Oxidase (Sigma Aldrich) 
* 50 uL of catalase (20 mg/mL; Sigma Aldrich) 
* Dissolve glucose oxidase in Dilution Buffer, vortex to mix. After mixing the catalase suspension well, add catalase to glucose oxidase solution.
* Centrifuge at maximum speed for 1 min. Catalase may visibly precipitate out and remain at the bottom of the tube. Use the yellow supernatant for imaging buffers. 
* Aliquot and freeze immediately. Store working tube at 4C for up to 1 week. Fresh (non-frozen) aliquots good for up to 2 weeks at 4C.

1.  50% (by mass) Glucose stock 
2.  BME (Sigma-Aldrich 63689-25ML-F)
