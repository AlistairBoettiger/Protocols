#### components
1. Lid and tank
2. Combs
3. Spacer plates
4. Short plates
5. Casting frame
6. Sample loading guides
7. Casting stand

#### Comb volumes
* 10-well (30 µl),
* 15-well (15 µl),
* prep well (450 µl),
* 10-well (50 µl),
* 12-well (20 µl),
* 9-well (30 µl),
* IPG comb (7 cm IPG strip)

### Gel volumes
* 0.75 mm 4.2 mL
* 1.0 mm 5.6 mL
* 1.5 mm 8.4 mL

### Casting the Gel 
#### Reagents (25 mL of gel 15% Denaturing Gel)
* 12g Urea
* 7 mL 40% acrylamide (19:1) Bis
* 2.5 mL 10x TBE
* 5.5 mL ddH2O
* 38 uL 10% APS (ammonium-persulfate). Make fresh from powder
* 38 uL TEMED

#### Procedure
* weigh out urea in 100 uL beaker
* add acrylamide, TBE and ddH2O
* add stir bar,
* cover with Parafilm
* stir and heat gently 3-5 minutes.  Let cool.
* Add 38 uL of TEMED and 38 uL of 10% APS.
* Mix well but quickly.  (on stir table?)
* Pour gels.  Makes 4 0.75 mm gels.  
* Note: Polymerization will happen soon after adding APS.  If it is too fast, use less APS.  
* Allow 1 hour for gels to fully polymerize before removing from casting unit.
* Unused gels may be stored for a few days to a week at 4C wrapped in Seran wrap with a moist paper towel backing.  Old gels may start to frown.    

## Running Gel
* Warm 1 L of 1x TBE buffer for 2:30 min in microwave. 
* Turn on water-bath to 60C.  Fill water bath with enough water to rise to the same level of buffer in the BioRad tank.
* Insert gel into gel box and load box into tank.  Pre-run gel for 10-30 minutes at 120 V to equilibrate gel temperature.
* Denature samples in loading buffer (e.g. 2x Urea-loading buffer from BioRad) at 90C for 2-5 min.  Return to water-ice bath.  
* Flush extra urea from wells prior to loading.
* Load sample, run gel for 50 minutes at 120 V. 
*  Gently extract gel from casing.  Incubate in 1x Gel-Green in 1x TBE for 10-30 minutes.  
*  Image Gel on Typhoon Imager
