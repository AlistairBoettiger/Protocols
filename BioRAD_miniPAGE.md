#### components
1. Lid and tank
2. Combs
3. Spacer plates
4. Short plates
5. Casting frame
6. Sample loading guides
7. Casting stand

#### Comb volumes
* 10-well (30 µl),
* 15-well (15 µl),
* prep well (450 µl),
* 10-well (50 µl),
* 12-well (20 µl),
* 9-well (30 µl),
* IPG comb (7 cm IPG strip)

### Gel volumes
* 0.75 mm 4.2 mL
* 1.0 mm 5.6 mL
* 1.5 mm 8.4 mL

### Casting the Gel 
#### Reagents (25 mL of gel 15% Denaturing Gel)
* 12g Urea
* 7 mL 40% acrylamide (19:1) Bis
* 2.5 mL 10x TBE
* 5.5 mL ddH2O
* 38 uL 10% APS (ammonium-persulfate). Make fresh from powder
* 38 uL TEMED

#### Procedure
* weigh out urea in 100 uL beaker
* add acrylamide, TBE and ddH2O
* add stir bar,
* cover with Parafilm
* stir and heat gently 3-5 minutes.  Let cool.
* Add 38 uL of TEMED and 38 uL of 10% APS.
* Mix well but quickly.  (on stir table?)
* Pour gels.  Makes 4 0.75 mm gels.  
* Note: Polymerization will happen soon after adding APS.  If it is too fast, use less APS.  

## Running Gel
* Warm 1 L of buffer for 2:30 min in microwave
* 

#### Notes
* Volumes may need adjustment, this is my first time through.
