## S2 Cell Culture, Invitrogen Protocol
Catalog no. R690-07

### Notes
Also useful for culture of S2R+ and Kc167 cells.  Protocol adapted from Invitrogen R690-07.


### Reagents and Equipment
* 15 ml sterile, conical tubes
* 5, 10, and 25 ml sterile pipettes
* Cryovials
* Hemacytometer and Trypan blue
* Complete Schneider's Drosophila Medium (contains 10% heat-inactivated fetal
bovine serum (FBS))
* Optional: Penicillin-Streptomycin (Final concentration 50 units penicillin G and
50 μg streptomycin sulfate per milliliter of culture)
* Table-top centrifuge
* 25 cm^2 flasks, 75 cm^2 flasks, and 35 mm plates (other flasks and plates may be used)
* Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS; available from Gibco, Catalog no. 10010-023)

### Culture from Frozen Stock 
* The vial of S2 cells supplied contains ~1 x 10^7 cells. Upon thawing, cells should have a viability of 60-70%. Once the culture is established, cell viability should be >95%.
1. Remove the vial of cells from liquid nitrogen and thaw quickly at 30°C.
2. Just before the cells are completely thawed, decontaminate the outside of the vial
with 70% ethanol and transfer the cells to a 25 cm^2 flask containing 5 ml of room
temperature complete Schneider's Drosophila Medium.
3. Incubate at 28°C for 30 minutes.
4. Resuspend the cells and centrifuge at 1000 x g. Decant the medium to remove the
DMSO and plate the cells in 5 ml fresh complete Schneider's Drosophila Medium.
5. Incubate at 28°C until cells reach a density of 6 to 20 x 10^6 cells/ml. This may take 3
to 4 days.

### Passaging Cells 
* Note: Cells will start to clump at a density of ~5 x 106 cells/ml in serum-containing medium. This does not seem to affect growth. Clumps can be broken up during passage.
1. S2 cells should be subcultured to a final density of 2 to 4 x 10^6 cells/ml. Do not split
cells below a density of 0.5 x 10^6 cells/ml.
For example, 2 ml of cells from a 75 cm2 flask at a density of 2 x10^7 cells/ml should
be placed into a new 75 cm^2 flask containing 10 ml of fresh complete Schneider''s
Drosophila Medium.
2. When removing cells from the flask, tap the flask several times to dislodge cells that
may be attached to the surface of the flask. Use a 5 ml pipette to wash down the
surface of the flask with the conditioned medium to remove the remaining adherent
S2 cells.
3. Once the cells have detached, briefly pipette the solution up and down to break up
clumps of cells.
4. Split cells at a 1:2 to 1:5 dilution into new culture vessels. Add complete Schneider's
Drosophila Medium and incubate at 28ûC incubator until the density reaches
6 to 20 x 106 cells/ml.
5. Repeat Steps 1-4 as necessary to expand cells for transfection or expression.

### Freezing S2 Cells 
*  Before starting, label ~15 cryovials and place on wet ice.
* Note: Freezing Medium is 45% conditioned complete Schneider's Drosophila Medium, 45% fresh complete Schneider's Drosophila Medium (containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS), and 10% DMSO. Be sure to reserve medium after centrifuging cells.
1. When cells are between 1.0-2.0 x 10^7 cells/ml in a 75 cm2 flask, remove the cells
from the flask. There should be 12 ml of cell suspension.
2. Count a sample of cells in a hemacytometer to determine actual cells/ml and the
viability (95-99%).
3. Pellet the cells by centrifuging at 1000 x g for 2 to 3 minutes in a table top centrifuge
at +4°C. Reserve the conditioned medium.
4. Resuspend the cells in 10 ml PBS and pellet at 1000 x g for 2 to 3 minutes.
5. Prepare Freezing Medium (see recipe above).
6. Resuspend the cells at a density of 1.1 x 10^7 cells/ml in Freezing Medium.
7. Aliquot 1 ml of the cell suspension per vial.
8. Freeze cells in a control rate freezer to -80°C, or wrap vials in paper towels and place
in a well-insulated container lined with additional paper towels. Transfer container to
-80°C and hold for 24 hours to allow for a slow freezing process.
9. Transfer vials to liquid nitrogen for long term storage.
